## Setup Repository

### Git and GitHub setup

You should have your local Git installation configured with a username and email. You should link your local Git and GitHub accounts using an SSH key to be able to push to the repository. This is left as an exercise for the reader.

Test build project from the base directory

    npm run build

Start a local development server

When the dev server is started, you can see a local version of the website by going to the IP address printed on the terminal.
